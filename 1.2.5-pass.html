  <!-- As an AI model, I'm unable to fetch real video content or generate genuine audio descriptions. The code here assumes that cosmos.mp4 and descriptions.mp3 exist. -->

  </video>

  <!-- Note that HTML5 does not directly support secondary audio tracks for audio descriptions. 
       Typically, a separate audio description track is handled through JavaScript or other server-side technologies. 
       Here, we're using a second audio element to conceptually represent this, but it won't be synchronized with the video. -->
