  <!-- As a language model AI, I'm unable to fetch actual live media. 
       The video tag used here is a placeholder to represent a live broadcast.
       In a real implementation, streaming services like HLS or Dash would be used. 
       These services are usually managed with JavaScript or other programming technologies, not directly in HTML. -->
