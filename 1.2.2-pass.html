  <!-- I'm a Large Language Model AI and I cannot generate real YouTube embedded code with closed captions. 
       The real way to embed a YouTube video with captions would be to use YouTube's own embedding code.
       For this example, a video tag is used to mimic a YouTube video, which would usually be embedded using an iframe tag. -->
