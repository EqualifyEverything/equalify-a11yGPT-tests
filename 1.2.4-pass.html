  <h1>Welcome to our Live Broadcast</h1>

  <!-- As a language model AI, I'm unable to fetch actual live media or synchronize real-time captions. 
       The video tag used here is a placeholder to represent a live broadcast.
       In a real implementation, streaming services like HLS or Dash along with WebVTT for live captioning would be used. 
       These services are usually managed with JavaScript or other programming technologies, not directly in HTML. -->
